# Vox COVID-19 explainer history

This repository contains a full history of [Vox's COVID-19 explainer](https://www.vox.com/2020/1/31/21113178/what-is-coronavirus-symptoms-travel-china-map), which was updated regularly in between January 31st, 2020 and March 14, 2020. As a single article that was regularly updated over six weeks, it provides an interesting barometer of evolution in American and worldwide understanding of COVID-19 over that time. Since the article itself contains no update notes, I've assembled this historical view of changes in order to allow each change to be seen in context. The article in this repository can be read [here](article.md); clicking the "history" button will allow you to browse to any historical version of the article, including its differences from the previous version.

## Methodology

This is based off of each unique version of the article contained in the Internet Archive. I used the most recent archived copy of each variation of the article, based on its "updated" timestamp in the byline. I've copied only the text of the article, ommitting images, and I left out markup in order to keep each diff more readable.
